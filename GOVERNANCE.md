# PieFed Governance

The PieFed project currently uses a governance model commonly described as Benevolent Dictator For Life
([BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)). This document outlines our implementation of
this model. A new governance model will be adopted when the project outgrows BDFL.

## Terms

- user: anyone who interacts with the project.

- contributor: anyone who has contributed to the project in any way and to any degree. Contributions may include code, 
documentation, reviews, manual testing, etc.

- core contributor: anyone who has contributed repeatedly and significantly to the project. Core contributors are 
recognized by Codeberg "Member" badges.

- Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL): the person who makes decisions when consensus cannot be reached. The projectâ€™s current BDFL is Rimu Atkinson.

## Decision Making Process

Contributors try to reach consensus via discussion. When consensus cannot be reached in a reasonable time, the BDFL 
takes the following steps:

- Creates an issue in [the project's Codeberg repository](https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi) labeled "governance" or
what ever is suitable.

- Waits at least 48 hours for contributors to add comments to the issue.

- Adds a comment with the final decision and closes the issue.

## Changing Governance

The BDFL may choose a replacement at any point and cede authority to them. If this happens, the 
decision must be announced and recorded in the manner described above for decisions in the absence 
of consensus.

The new BDFL must clearly state that they accept their new responsibilities.

The time at which the new BDFL assumes their responsibilities must be clearly stated.

The BDFL may alternatively decide to move to a Steering Committee governance model, 
[or any other model](https://communityrule.info/templates/), in which case this document must be replaced 
with a new description of roles and responsibilities.
