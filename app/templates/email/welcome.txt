Hello {{ first_name }} and welcome!

I'm Rimu, the founder of PieFed and I'd like to personally thank you for signing up.

As PieFed is still in an early development phase, your thoughts and ideas mean the world to me. You might stumble upon a
    few hiccups or notice some missing bits here and there â€” that's totally expected. Just hit reply to this email and
    let me know what's up. Screenshots, if you've got 'em, will make a world of difference!

If you are technically-minded, reporting issues on the Codeberg issue tracker at https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi/issues
 would be awesome. And hey, if Python's your jam and you're keen to pitch in, check out the project site https://join.piefed.social/
  or delve into the code repository https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi/ for more info.

PieFed is entirely self-funded so donations are much appreciated https://liberapay.com/PieFed/donate.

Warm regards,

Rimu Atkinson
Founder
