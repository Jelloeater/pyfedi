# Contributing to PyFedi

When it matures enough, PyFedi will aim to work in a way consistent with the [Collective Code Construction Contract](https://42ity.org/c4.html).

Please discuss your ideas in an issue at https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi/issues before 
starting any large pieces of work to ensure alignment with the roadmap, architecture and processes.

The general style and philosphy behind the way things have been constructed is well described by 
[The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/). If that page resonates with you then you'll
probably enjoy your time here! The codebase needs to be simple enough that new developers of all
skill levels can easily understand what's going on and onboard quickly without a lot of upfront 
time investment. Sometimes this will mean writing slightly more verbose/boring code or avoiding the
use of advanced design patterns.

Mailing list, Matrix channel, etc still to come.

# Technology stack

- Python 
- Flask
- Jinja
- SCSS
- SQL - Postgresql

Python developers with no Flask experience can quickly learn Flask by exploring the 
[Flask Mega Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) 
which will guide them through the process of building a simple social media app. Django is
very similar to Flask so developers familiar with that framework will have an easier
time of things.

# Coding Standards / Guidelines

**[PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)** covers the basics. PyCharm encourages this by default - 
VS Code coders are encouraged to try the free community edition of PyCharm but it is by no means required. 

Use PEP 8 conventions for line length, naming, indentation. Use descriptive commit messages.

Database model classes are singular. As in "Car", not "Cars".

### Directory structure

Where possible, the structure should match the URL structure of the site. e.g. "domain.com/admin" 
should be in a directory called "admin". Exceptions to this are '/activitypub' which contains
modules for server-to-server communication and 'main' which is all the public non-authenticated
parts of the app.

Most of the interesting code is in the /app directory. Within that are:

 - /templates which contains all the Jinja2 code for rendering HTML.
 - /static is all the images, CSS and JS files. SCSS files are compiled into CSS.
 - /utils.py contains misc helpful functions. Within each directory is often another utils.py for
helpful functions that pertain to modules in that directory only.
 - /models.py is the database interface. Each class in this file corresponds to a table in the database. 
Changes to this file are turned into changes in the DB by using '[migrations](https://www.onlinetutorialspoint.com/flask/flask-how-to-upgrade-or-downgrade-database-migrations.html)'.
 - /community/* pertains to viewing, posting within and managing communities.
