Please discuss your ideas in an issue at https://codeberg.org/rimu/pyfedi/issues before 
starting any large pieces of work to ensure alignment with the roadmap, architecture and processes.

The general style and philosphy behind the way things have been constructed is well described by 
[The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/). If that page resonates with you then you'll
probably enjoy your time here!

Mailing list, Matrix channel, etc still to come.
